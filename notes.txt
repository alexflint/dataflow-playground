# bigquery
datasets
tables
 loading
 schemas
 repeated and nested columns
views
 tables that are created as the result of a query
 read-only
 store references back to original table
 convenient tools exist to update them


# dataflow
read rows from a table (or a query on a table)
write rows to a table (append / truncate / etc)

# pubsub
create topics
create subscriptions separately (can be pull or push)
 each subscription recieves each message exactly once
 messages are buffered on subscriptions until they are delivered
 if multiple clients connect to the same subscription then they each receive approx half of the messages
then connect to a subscription

# data studio
part of "google analytics 360 suite" - targetted at marketers
basic interface is like a presentation app - you can design things
can pull in queries from bigquery (also other data sources including files on google storage, sheets, etc)
seems like a nice way to produce good-looking reports
UI is a bit slow

# datalab
seems to be jupyter as a service
each user has their own instance
sharing instances is explicitly not supported
seems to be specifically focussed at data science
it works by starting a jupyter notebook instance on GCE, then opening a proxy tunnel
commands:
 datalab create foo
 datalab connect foo


# jupyter
bigquery has direct support for jupyter via
 1) exporting query results as pandas dataframes
 2) some special %%bigquery cell magic
